/*Prompt:
From Leetcode 1795. Rearrange Products Table
Write an SQL query to rearrange the Products table so that each row has (product_id, store, price). 
If a product is not available in a store, do not include a row with that product_id and store combination in the result table.
 
Code                                Explanation      
select product_id,	                Select the product ID as usual
select product_id,	                Select the product ID as usual
'store1' as store,                	Write Store1 in a column labeled Store for each selected item
store1 as price from products     	Write the price for Store 1 from Products in a price column
where store1 is not null	          Only choose pieces of data where Store1 doesn't have 'null' price.
union	                              Combine these results with the following

This line repeats for each of the stores in order to get all of the information in place.*/

SELECT product_id, 'store1' AS store, store1 AS price FROM Products WHERE store1 IS NOT NULL
UNION
Select product_id, 'store2' AS store, store2 as price FROM Products WHERE store2 IS NOT NULL
UNION
SELECT product_id, 'store3' AS store, store3 AS price FROM Products WHERE store3 IS NOT NULL
